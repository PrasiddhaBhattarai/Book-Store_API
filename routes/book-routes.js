// why is function is not invoked with parentheses (i.e., deleteBook())?
// 
// In Express (and other similar frameworks), routes like router.delete() or router.get() expect a callback function as the second argument. This callback function is executed when a specific HTTP request (like DELETE) is made to the specified route (/book/:id in this case).
//
// The deleteBook function is passed by reference into the route handler. It will be called automatically when an HTTP DELETE request is made to /book/:id. You donâ€™t invoke it immediately because Express itself will invoke the function when a request matches the route.
